# Build a Blog Aggregator in TypeScript

gator is a blog aggregator microservice built in TypeScript. This is built for the guided project "Build a Blog Aggregator in TypeScript" from Boot.dev.

The assignment asked me to write a real README.md, but I don't feel like doing that and both Boots and ChatGPT weren't super helpful, so this is it. ðŸ™ƒ
